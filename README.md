# BMI-Index
This Python programme determines a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight, offering a fundamental evaluation of their body composition. Based on their weight-to-height ratio, the BMI is a widely used statistic to classify whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
